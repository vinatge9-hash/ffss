# PeakFit Gym Website

This project contains a 3-page gym website generated for a typical fitness facility. It follows a modern, responsive design using Tailwind CSS via CDN and category-aligned typography.

What you get
- index.html: Home page with a full-bleed hero, program highlights, testimonials, and a category-consistent footer.
- about.html: Brand story, meet-the-team section, and value proposition.
- contact.html: Contact form and location details with a map placeholder area.
- README.md: Documentation and customization guidelines.

Fonts and typography
- Headings use Oswald (font-family: Oswald).
- Body uses Roboto (font-family: Roboto).
- Fonts are loaded from Google Fonts and applied via Tailwind classes (font-oswald and font-roboto).

Color system
- Primary color for gym: crimson variety (e.g., #DC143C) used for CTAs and accents.
- Footer uses a dark theme to reflect a professional gym environment.

Assets
- Images are placeholders in the hero sections: https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1688283099484-5dde2350c5d5?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=M3w3ODkyNDZ8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHw2fHwuLi58ZW58MHwwfHx8MTc1OTQyNzU1OXww&ixlib=rb-4.1.0&q=80&w=1080 syntax used to indicate category-appropriate imagery.

How to run
- Simply open index.html in a browser. The site uses Tailwind CDN, so no build tools are required.

Extending
- To add more pages, follow the existing structure and ensure the navigation links are updated to point to new files.
- You can adjust colors by swapping the Tailwind arbitrary color values (bg-[#DC143C], etc.).
